## Data Collection

The data used was data provided by Kaggle. The data is largely divided into Violence and NonViolence for 1000 images each.

I have used `InceptionV3` which is a pretrained Imagenet CNN model provided by `Keras`.

## Output
Output is in the form of a video, which will tell violence/ non-violence on the top left corner.
